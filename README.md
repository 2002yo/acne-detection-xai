# Explainable AI–Based Acne Detection System

## Overview
This Final Year Project focuses on developing an AI-powered acne detection system that identifies acne types and severity levels from facial images using deep learning.To improve transparency and trust, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are integrated to visually explain model predictions.

##  Objectives
- Detect acne lesions from facial images
- Classify acne types and severity levels
- Provide visual explanations using XAI methods
- Develop a user-friendly web interface for detection and results

## Technologies Used
**Frontend**
- React.js (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Fast API

### Machine Learning / AI
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for acne type classification
- Python + YOLOv8 for acne lesion detection
- Grad-CAM for visual feature highlighting
- LIME for local explanation of predictions

## System Features
- Image upload for acne detection
- Acne lesion detection using bounding boxes
- Classification of acne type and severity level
- Grad-CAM heatmaps to highlight important image regions
- LIME-based explanations for model predictions
- Web-based results visualization
- Downloadable PDFs
